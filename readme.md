# Grants website design system codecademy project
   
This project is a basic design system for a website.   

 It was based on the example provided, with the intention of adding new styles and components in future.


The project requires three sections:

* A color section which includes their name, a box of the color and the CSS value used to create the color.

* A labled section of fonts including the font name, the styles intended to be used (such as bold and italic), as well as words to display the font.

* A section for text styles and page elements. This includes the page element name, and the style rules specific to that element.

Additionally a footer has been added with a link to my github page.
